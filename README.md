A demonstration of four different implementations of client side routing using React. First, with React Router 5.3.4 and useEffect. Second, with React Router 6.4.3 and useEffect. Third, with React Router 6.4.3. and Remix-style data loading. And, finally, with Tanstack Router and their native data loading tech.

Just download or form the repo, then go into the folder of whichever router you want test and type "npm i". Then, "npm start" to spin up the dev server.
